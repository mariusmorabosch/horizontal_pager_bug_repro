# horizontal_pager_bug_repro

Sample app for horizontal pager bug. It looks like the compose pager with pager indicator sometimes causes the scroll
to not work properly when going back and forth. If you remove the paging indicators the bug seems to disappear. 

Reproduced on a Pixel 5a (Android 13), not possible to reproduce on every device.
